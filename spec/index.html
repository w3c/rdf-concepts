  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The <em>Resource Description Framework</em> (RDF) is a framework
  for representing information in the Web.</p>

  <p>This document defines an abstract syntax (a data model)
  which serves to link all RDF-based languages and specifications,
  including the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the formal model-theoretic semantics for RDF [[RDF12-SEMANTICS]]</li>

    <li>serialization syntaxes for storing and exchanging RDF such as [[[RDF12-TURTLE]]] [[RDF12-TURTLE]]
      and [[[JSON-LD11]]] [[JSON-LD11]]</li>

    <li>the [[[SPARQL12-QUERY]]] [[SPARQL12-QUERY]]</li>

    <li>the [[[RDF12-SCHEMA]]] [[RDF12-SCHEMA]]</li>
  </ul>

  <section id="data-model">
    <h3>Graph-based Data Model</h3>

    <p>The core structure of the abstract syntax is a set of
      <a data-lt="RDF triple">triples</a>, each consisting of a <a>subject</a>,
      a <a>predicate</a> and an <a>object</a>. A set of such triples is called
      an <a>RDF graph</a>. An RDF graph can be visualized as a node and
      directed-arc diagram, in which each triple is represented as a
      node-arc-node link.</p>

    <figure id="fig-rdf-graph">
      <a href="rdf-graph.svg"><img src="rdf-graph.svg" alt="An RDF graph with two nodes (Subject and Object) and a triple connecting them (Predicate)" /></a>
      <figcaption>An RDF graph with two nodes (Subject and Object) and a triple connecting them (Predicate)</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>There can be four kinds of <a>nodes</a> in an
      <a>RDF graph</a>: <a>IRIs</a>, <a>literals</a>,
      <a>blank nodes</a>, and <a>triple terms</a>.</p>

    <p class="issue" data-number="129">There is a mixture of "Abstract Syntax" and "Data Model". We should have a consistent way to say "Abstract Syntax" vs "Data Model". One way is to use "Abstract Syntax" as the basis of semantics and usually say "Data Model" in Concepts otherwise.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="resources-and-statements">
    <h3>Resources and Statements</h3>

    <p>Any <a>IRI</a> or <a>literal</a> <dfn data-lt="denote" data-local-lt="denoted">denotes</dfn>
    something in the world (the "universe of discourse").
    These things are called
    <span id="dfn-resources"><!-- obsolete term --></span>
    <dfn data-lt="resource">resources</dfn>. Anything can be a resource,
    including physical things, documents, abstract concepts, numbers
    and strings; the term is synonymous with "entity" as it is used in
    [[[RDF12-SEMANTICS]]] [[RDF12-SEMANTICS]].
    The resource denoted by an IRI is called its <a>referent</a>, and the
    resource denoted by a literal is called its
    <a>literal value</a>. Literals have
    <a>datatypes</a> that define the range of possible
    values, such as strings, numbers, and dates. Special kinds of literals &mdash;
    <a>language-tagged strings</a> and <a>directional language-tagged strings</a> &mdash;
    respectively denote plain-text strings in a natural language, and plain-text
    strings in a natural language including an initial text direction.</p>

    <p>Asserting an <a>RDF triple</a> says that <em>some relationship,
    indicated by the <a>predicate</a>, holds between the
    <a>resources</a> <a>denoted</a> by
    the <a>subject</a> and <a>object</a></em>. This statement corresponding
    to an RDF triple is known as an <dfn data-local-lt="statement">RDF statement</dfn>.
    The predicate itself is an <a>IRI</a> and denotes a <dfn class="export">property</dfn>,
    that is, a <a>resource</a> that can be thought of as a binary relation.
    (Relations that involve more than two entities can only be
    <a data-cite="SWBP-N-ARYRELATIONS#">indirectly
    expressed in RDF</a> [[SWBP-N-ARYRELATIONS]].)</p>

    <p>Unlike <a>IRIs</a> and <a>literals</a>,
      <a>blank nodes</a> do not identify specific
      <a>resources</a>. <a>Statements</a>
      involving blank nodes say that something with the given relationships
      exists, without explicitly naming it.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="referents">
    <h3>The Referent of an IRI</h3>

    <p>The <a>resource</a> <a>denoted</a> by an <a>IRI</a>
      is also called its <dfn>referent</dfn>. For some IRIs with particular
      meanings, such as those identifying XSD datatypes, the referent is
      fixed by this specification. For all other IRIs, what exactly is
      <a>denoted</a> by any given IRI is not defined by this specification. Other
      specifications may fix IRI referents, or apply other constraints on
      what may be the referent of any IRI.</p>

    <p>Guidelines for determining the <a>referent</a> of an <a>IRI</a> are
      provided in other documents, like
      [[[WEBARCH]]] [[WEBARCH]]
      and [[[COOLURIS]]] [[COOLURIS]].
      A very brief, informal, and partial account follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>By design, IRIs have global scope. Thus, two different appearances of an IRI
        <a>denote</a> the same <a>resource</a>. Violating this principle constitutes
        an <a data-cite="WEBARCH#URI-collision">IRI collision</a> [[WEBARCH]].</li>

      <li>By social convention, the
        <a data-cite="WEBARCH#uri-ownership">IRI owner</a>
        [[WEBARCH]] gets to say what the intended (or usual)
        referent of an <a>IRI</a> is. Applications and users need not
        abide by this intended denotation, but there may be a loss of
        interoperability with other applications and users if they do
        not do so.</li>

      <li>The IRI owner can establish the intended <a>referent</a>
        by means of a specification or other document that explains
        what is denoted. For example, the
        [[[VOCAB-ORG]]] [[VOCAB-ORG]]
        specifies the intended referents of various IRIs that start with
        <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/org#</code>.</li>

      <li>A good way of communicating the intended referent
        is to set up the IRI so that it
        <a data-cite="WEBARCH#uri-dereference">dereferences</a> [[WEBARCH]]
        to such a document.</li>

      <li>Such a document can, in fact, be an <a>RDF document</a>
        that describes the denoted resource by means of
        <a>RDF statements</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Perhaps the most important characteristic of <a>IRIs</a>
      in web architecture is that they can be
      <a data-cite="WEBARCH#uri-dereference">dereferenced</a>,
      and hence serve as starting points for interactions with a remote server.
      This specification is not concerned with such interactions.
      It does not define an interaction model. It only treats IRIs as globally
      unique identifiers in a graph data model that describes resources.
      However, those interactions are critical to the concept of
      [[[LINKED-DATA]]], [[LINKED-DATA]],
      which makes use of the RDF data model and serialization formats.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="vocabularies">
    <h3>RDF Vocabularies and Namespace IRIs</h3>

    <p>An <dfn data-local-lt="vocabulary">RDF vocabulary</dfn> is a collection of <a>IRIs</a>
      intended for use in <a>RDF graphs</a>. For example,
      the IRIs documented in [[RDF12-SCHEMA]] are the RDF Schema vocabulary.
      RDF Schema can itself be used to define and document additional
      RDF vocabularies. Some such vocabularies are mentioned in the
      Primer [[RDF12-PRIMER]].</p>

    <p>The <a>IRIs</a> in an <a>RDF vocabulary</a> often begin with
      a common substring known as a <dfn>namespace IRI</dfn>.
      Some namespace IRIs are associated by convention with a short name
      known as a <dfn>namespace prefix</dfn>. Some examples:

    <table id="tab-vocab-ns" class="simple">
      <caption>Some example namespace prefixes and IRIs</caption>
      <tr>
        <th>Namespace prefix</th>
        <th>Namespace IRI</th>
        <th>RDF vocabulary</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>rdf</td>
        <td><a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"><code>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#</code></a></td>
        <td>The RDF built-in vocabulary [[RDF12-SCHEMA]]</td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td>rdfs</td>
        <td><a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"><code>http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#</code></a></td>
        <td>The RDF Schema vocabulary [[RDF12-SCHEMA]]</td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td>xsd</td>
        <td><a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#"><code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#</code></a></td>
        <td>The <a>RDF-compatible XSD types</a></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>In some serialization formats it is common to abbreviate <a>IRIs</a>
      that start with <a>namespace IRIs</a> by using a
      <a>namespace prefix</a> in order to assist readability. For example, the IRI
      <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral</code>
      would be abbreviated as <code>rdf:XMLLiteral</code>.
      Note however that these abbreviations are <em>not</em> valid IRIs,
      and must not be used in contexts where IRIs are expected.
      Namespace IRIs and namespace prefixes are <em>not</em> a formal part of the
      RDF data model. They are merely a syntactic convenience for
      abbreviating IRIs.</p>

    <p>The term “<dfn class="lint-ignore">namespace</dfn>” on its own does not have a
      well-defined meaning in the context of RDF, but is sometimes informally
      used to mean “<a>namespace IRI</a>” or “<a>RDF vocabulary</a>”.</p>

  <section id="section-triple-terms-reification">
    <h3>Triple Terms and Reification</h3>

    <p>A <a>triple term</a> is an [=RDF triple=] used as an [=RDF term=]
      in the [=object=] position of another triple.</p>

    <p>A <a>triple term</a> is not necessarily asserted, allowing
      statements to be made about other statements that may not be
      asserted within an <a>RDF graph</a>.
      This allows statements to be made about relationships that may be contradictory.
      For a <a>triple term</a> to be asserted,
      it must also appear in a graph as an <a>asserted triple</a>.</p>

    <p>A <a>triple term</a> can be used as the object of a <a>triple</a> with the predicate <code>rdf:reifies</code>;
      such a <a>triple</a> is then a <dfn>reifying triple</dfn>.
      The <a>subject</a> of that <a>triple</a> is called a <dfn>reifier</dfn>.
      Assertions on the <a>triple term</a> are made using the <a>reifier</a>.
      A concrete syntax may provide a special notation for specifying <a>reifying triples</a>.</p>

    <p class="note">Using the <a>reifier</a> as an indirect way of referencing a <a>triple term</a>
      allows multiple groups of assertions to be separated from each other,
      which might be necessary if the same <a>triple term</a> was derived from different sources.
      Assertions are always made using the <a>reifier</a>, which can be the <a>subject</a> or <a>object</a>
      of different triples.
      Concrete syntaxes, such as Turtle [[RDF12-TURTLE]],
      may have shortcuts for capturing a <a>triple term</a> with its <a>reifier</a>.</p>

    <p>The following diagram represents a statement and a reification of an unasserted <a>triple term</a>.</p>

  <section id="change-over-time">
    <h3>RDF and Change over Time</h3>

    <p>The RDF data model is <em>atemporal</em>: <a>RDF graphs</a>
      are static snapshots of information.</p>

    <p>However, <a>RDF graphs</a> can express information
      about events and about temporal aspects of other entities,
      given appropriate <a>vocabulary</a> terms.</p>

    <p>Since <a>RDF graphs</a> are defined as mathematical
      sets, adding or removing <a>triples</a> from an
      RDF graph yields a different RDF graph.</p>

    <p>We informally use the term <dfn>RDF source</dfn> to refer to a
      persistent yet mutable source or container of
      <a>RDF graphs</a>. An RDF source is a <a>resource</a>
      that may be said to have a state that can change over time.
      A snapshot of the state can be expressed as an RDF graph.
      For example, any web document that has an RDF-bearing representation
      may be considered an RDF source. Like all resources, RDF sources may
      be named with <a>IRIs</a> and therefore described in
      other RDF graphs.</p>

    <p>Intuitively speaking, changes in the universe of discourse
      can be reflected in the following ways:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>An <a>IRI</a>, once minted, should never
        change its intended <a>referent</a>. (See
        <a data-cite="WEBARCH#URI-persistence">URI persistence</a>
        [[WEBARCH]].)</li>
      <li><a>Literals</a>, by design, are constants and
        never change their <a data-lt="literal value">value</a>.</li>
      <li>A relationship that holds between two <a>resources</a>
        at one time may not hold at another time.</li>
      <li><a>RDF sources</a> may change their state over time.
        That is, they may provide different <a>RDF graphs</a>
        at different times.</li>
      <li>Some <a>RDF sources</a> may, however, be immutable
        snapshots of another RDF source, archiving its state at some
        point in time.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="managing-graphs">
    <h3>Working with Multiple RDF Graphs</h3>

    <p>As RDF graphs are sets of triples, they can be
      combined easily, supporting the use of data from
      multiple sources. Nevertheless, it is sometimes desirable to work
      with multiple RDF graphs while keeping their contents separate.
      <a>RDF datasets</a> support this requirement.</p>

    <p>An <a>RDF dataset</a> is a collection of
      <a>RDF graphs</a>. All but one of these graphs have
      an associated <a>IRI</a> or blank node. They are called
      <a>named graphs</a>, and the IRI or blank node
      is called the <a>graph name</a>.
      The remaining graph does not have an associated IRI, and is called
      the <a>default graph</a> of the RDF dataset.</p>

    <p>There are many possible uses for <a>RDF datasets</a>.
      One such use is to hold snapshots of multiple
      <a>RDF sources</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="entailment">
    <h3>Equivalence, Entailment and Inconsistency</h3>

    <p>An <a>RDF triple</a> encodes a <dfn class="export">proposition</dfn> — a
      simple logical expression, describing a relationship between two entities.
      An [=asserted triple=] is a claim that the corresponding proposition is true.
      An <a>RDF graph</a> is the conjunction (logical <em>AND</em>) of
      all the claims made by its [=asserted triples=].
      The precise details of this meaning of [=RDF triples=] and [=RDF graphs=] are
      the subject of [[[RDF12-SEMANTICS]]] [[RDF12-SEMANTICS]], which yields the

    <p>An <span id="dfn-entailment-regime"><!-- obsolete term --></span><dfn data-cite="RDF12-SEMANTICS#dfn-entailment-regime">entailment regime</dfn> [[RDF12-SEMANTICS]] is a specification that
      defines precise conditions that make these relationships hold.
      RDF itself recognizes only some basic cases of entailment, <a>equivalence</a>
      and inconsistency. Other specifications, such as
      [[[RDF12-SCHEMA]]] [[RDF12-SCHEMA]]
      and <a data-cite="owl2-overview#">OWL 2</a>
      [[OWL2-OVERVIEW]], add more powerful entailment regimes,
      as do some domain-specific <a>vocabularies</a>.</p>

    <p>This specification does not constrain how implementations
      use the logical relationships defined by
      <a>entailment regimes</a>.
      Implementations may or may not detect
      <a>inconsistencies</a>, and may make all,
      some or no <a data-lt="entailment">entailed</a> information
      available to users.</p>

    <h3>RDF Documents and Syntaxes</h3>

    <p>An <dfn>RDF document</dfn> is a document that encodes an
      <a>RDF graph</a> or <a>RDF dataset</a> in a <dfn>concrete RDF syntax</dfn>,
      such as Turtle [[RDF12-TURTLE]], RDFa [[RDFA-CORE]], JSON-LD [[JSON-LD11]], or
      TriG [[RDF12-TRIG]]. RDF documents enable the exchange of RDF graphs and RDF
      datasets between systems.</p>

    <p>A <a>concrete RDF syntax</a> may offer
      many different ways to encode the same <a>RDF graph</a> or
      <a>RDF dataset</a>, for example through the use of
      <a>namespace prefixes</a>,
      <a>IRI references</a>, <a>blank node identifiers</a>,
      and different ordering of triples. While these aspects can have great
      effect on the convenience of working with the <a>RDF document</a>,
      they are not significant for its meaning.</p>

    Implementations cannot directly conform to
    <em>RDF 1.2 Concepts and Abstract Syntax</em>,

      Concrete syntaxes in which such graphs and datasets can be expressed include
      [[RDF12-N-TRIPLES]], [[RDF12-N-QUADS]], [[RDF12-TURTLE]], and [[RDF12-TRIG]].</li>
    <li><dfn class="no-export lint-ignore" data-lt="classic">Classic conformance</dfn>

    <h3>Strings in RDF</h3>

    <p>RDF uses Unicode [[Unicode]] as the fundamental representation for string values.
      Within this, and related specifications, the term <dfn id="dfn-rdf-string">string</dfn>,
      or <a data-lt="string">RDF string</a>,
      is used to describe an ordered sequence of zero or more
      <a data-cite="I18N-GLOSSARY#dfn-code-point" class="lint-ignore">Unicode code points</a>
      which are <a data-cite="I18N-GLOSSARY#dfn-scalar-value" class="lint-ignore">Unicode scalar values</a>.
      Unicode scalar values do not include the
      <a data-cite="I18N-GLOSSARY#dfn-surrogate" class="lint-ignore">surrogate code points</a>.
      Note that most <a>concrete RDF syntaxes</a> require the use
      of the UTF-8 character encoding [[!RFC3629]], 
      and use the `\u0000` or `\U00000000` forms to express certain non-character values.
</p>

    <p>A string is identical to another string if it consists of the same sequence of code points.
      An implementation MAY determine string equality by comparing the
      <a data-cite="I18N-GLOSSARY#dfn-code-unit">code units</a> of two strings
      that use the same <a data-cite="I18N-GLOSSARY#dfn-character-encoding">Unicode character encoding</a>

  <h2>RDF Graphs</h2>

  <p>An <dfn>RDF graph</dfn> is a set of <a>RDF triples</a>.</p>

  <p>An [=RDF triple=] is said to be <dfn id="dfn-asserted-triple" class=export data-lt="asserted triple|asserted triples" data-lt-no-plural=""

    <h3>Triples</h3>

    <p>An <dfn data-local-lt="triple" class="export">RDF triple</dfn>
     (often simply called "triple")
     is a 3-tuple that is defined inductively as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        If |s| is an [=IRI=] or a [=blank node=],
        |p| is an [=IRI=], and

        then (|s|, |p|, |o|) is an [=RDF triple=].
      </li>

      <li>
        If |s| is an [=IRI=] or a [=blank node=],
        |p| is an [=IRI=], and

    </ul>

    <p>The three components (|s|, |p|, |o|) of an [=RDF triple=] are respectively called the <dfn class=export >subject</dfn>, <dfn class=export >predicate</dfn> and <dfn class=export >object</dfn> of the triple.</p>


    <p class="note">The definition of <a>triple</a> is recursive.
      That is, a <a>triple</a> can itself have an

    <h3>RDF Terms</h3>

    <p><a>IRIs</a>, <a>literals</a>,

    <p><a>IRIs</a>, <a>literals</a>,

      For example, a literal with the string <code>http://example.org/</code> as

      is not equal to the IRI <code>http://example.org/</code>,
      nor to a blank node with the <a>blank node identifier</a>
      <code>http://example.org/</code>.</p>

    <p>The set of <span id="dfn-nodes"><!-- obsolete term--></span><dfn data-lt="node">nodes</dfn> of an <a>RDF graph</a>
      is the set of <a>subjects</a> and <a>objects</a> of the <a>asserted triples</a> of the graph.
      It is possible for a [=predicate=] [=IRI=] to also occur as a [=node=] in

    <h3>IRIs</h3>

    <p>An <dfn data-lt="iri"><abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifier">IRI</abbr></dfn>
      (Internationalized Resource Identifier) within an RDF graph
      is a <a>string</a> that conforms to the syntax
      defined in RFC 3987 [[!RFC3987]].</p>

    <p>An IRI in the RDF abstract syntax 
      MUST be <a data-cite="RFC3986#section-5">resolved</a> per [[RFC3986]] and
      MUST NOT be a <a data-cite="RFC3986#section-4.2">relative reference</a>.
      An IRI MAY contain a <a data-cite="RFC3986#section-3.5">fragment identifier</a>.
      An IRI SHOULD follow rules defined by the <a data-cite="RFC3986#section-3.1">IRI scheme</a>.
    </p>

    <p><dfn>IRI equality</dfn>:
      Two IRIs are the same if and only if they consist of the same sequence of
      <a data-cite="I18N-GLOSSARY#dfn-code-point" class="lint-ignore">Unicode code points</a>,
      as in Simple String Comparison in
      <a data-cite="rfc3987#section-5.3.1">section 5.3.1</a> of [[!RFC3987]].
      (This is done in the abstract syntax, so the IRIs are resolved
      IRIs with no escaping or encoding.)
      Further normalization MUST NOT be performed before this comparison. </p>

    <p class="note">For convenience, a complete [[ABNF]] grammar
      from [[RFC3987]] is provided in <a href="#iri-abnf" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>

    <div class="note" id="note-iris">
      <p><strong>URIs and IRIs:</strong>
        IRIs are a generalization of
        <dfn data-lt="URI" data-lt-noDefault><abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s</dfn>
        [[RFC3986]] that permits a wider range of Unicode characters [[UNICODE]].
        Every URI and URL is an IRI, but not every IRI is an URI.
        In RDF, IRIs are used as <dfn data-lt="iri reference">IRI references</dfn>, as defined in [[RFC3987]]
        <a data-cite="RFC3987#section-1.3">section 1.3</a>.
        An IRI reference is common usage of an Internationalized Resource Identifier.
        An IRI reference refers to either a resolved <a>IRI</a> or <a>relative IRI reference</a>,
        as described by the <em>IRI-reference</em> production in <a href="#iri-abnf" class="sectionRef"></a>.
        The abstract syntax uses only fully resolved <a>IRIs</a>.
        When IRIs are used in operations that are only
        defined for URIs, they must first be converted according to
        the mapping defined in
        <a data-cite="rfc3987#section-3.1">section 3.1</a>
        of [[!RFC3987]]. A notable example is retrieval over the HTTP
        protocol. The mapping involves UTF-8 encoding of non-ASCII
        characters, %-encoding of octets not allowed in URIs, and
        Punycode-encoding of domain names.</p>

      <p><strong>URLs:</strong>
        The [[[URL]]] is largely compatible with [[RFC3987]] IRIs,
        but is based on a processing model important for implementation
        within web browsers and are not described using an [[ABNF]] grammar.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Relative IRI references:</strong>
        Some <a>concrete RDF syntaxes</a> permit
        <span id="dfn-relative-iris"><!-- obsolete term--></span>
        <dfn id="dfn-relative-iri" data-lt="relative iri reference">relative IRI references</dfn> as a convenient shorthand
        that allows authoring of documents independently from their final
        publishing location.
        Relative IRI references must be
        <a data-cite="rfc3986#section-5.2">resolved against</a> a
        <dfn class="export">base IRI</dfn>.
        Therefore, the RDF graph serialized in such syntaxes is well-defined only
        if a <a data-cite="rfc3986#section-5.1">base IRI
        can be established</a> [[RFC3986]].</p>

      <p><strong>URI Schemes:</strong>
        Implementations are encouraged to enforce the scheme-specific rules of
        the common schemes, such as the
        <a data-cite="RFC7230#section-2.7.1">scheme rules for HTTP/HTTPS</a> and the
        <a data-cite="did-core#identifier">DID syntax</a>.
        Implementations ignore URI scheme rules
        for schemes they do not recognize. 
      </p>

      <p><strong>IRI normalization:</strong>
        Interoperability problems can be avoided by minting
        only IRIs that are normalized according to
        <a data-cite="rfc3987#section-5">Section 5</a>
        of [[!RFC3987]]. 
        </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Use lowercase characters in scheme names.</li>
        <li>Only use percent-encoding of characters where required by the IRI syntax.</li>
        <li>Omit the HTTP or HTTPS default port; <code>http://example/</code>
          is preferred over <code>http://example:80/</code>.</li>
        <li>Use uppercase hexadecimal letters within percent-encoding
          triplets;"<code>%3F</code>" is preferred over
          "<code>%3f</code>".</li>
        <li>An empty path in an HTTP IRI
          <code>http://example/</code> is preferred over
          having no path <code>http://example</code>.</li>
        <li>Normalize IRIs to remove "<code>/./</code>" and "<code>/../</code>" in the path
          component of an IRI.</li>  
        <li>Use lowercase characters in domain names. 
          Note that, while ASCII characters in domain names are case-insensitive, 
          non-ASCII characters in domain names are case-sensitive [[RFC5890]].
          Domains are generally only registered with lowercase letters [[RFC5892]].</li>
        <li>Avoid using the

    <h3>Literals</h3>

    <p>Literals are used for values such as strings, numbers, and dates.</p>

    <p>A <dfn data-local-lt="RDF literal">literal</dfn> in an <a>RDF graph</a> consists of
      two, three, or four elements, as follow:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>a <dfn>lexical form</dfn> consisting of a sequence of
        <a data-cite="I18N-GLOSSARY#dfn-code-point" class="lint-ignore">Unicode code points</a> [[!UNICODE]]
        which are <a data-cite="I18N-GLOSSARY#dfn-scalar-value">Unicode scalar values</a>,
        and therefore do not contain
        <a data-cite="I18N-GLOSSARY#dfn-surrogate" class="lint-ignore">Unicode surrogate code points</a></li>
      <li>a <dfn>datatype IRI</dfn>, being an <a>IRI</a>
        identifying a datatype that determines how the lexical form maps
        to a <a>literal value</a></li>
      <li>if and only if the <a>datatype IRI</a> is
        <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString</code>, a
        non-empty <dfn>language tag</dfn> as defined by [[!BCP47]]. The
        language tag MUST be well-formed according to
        <a data-cite="bcp47#section-2.2.9">section 2.2.9</a>
        of [[!BCP47]],
        and MUST be treated consistently, that is, in a case insensitive manner.
        Two language tags are the same if they only differ by case.</li>
      <li>if and only if the <a>datatype IRI</a> is
        <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#dirLangString</code>,
        a non-empty <a>language tag</a>
        that MUST be well-formed according to <a data-cite="bcp47#section-2.2.9">section 2.2.9</a>
        of [[!BCP47]],
        and MUST be treated consistently, that is, in a case insensitive manner,
        and a <dfn>base direction</dfn> that MUST be either `ltr` or `rtl`.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>A literal is a <dfn>language-tagged string</dfn> if the third element
      is present and the fourth element is not present.
      Lexical representations of language tags MAY be case normalized,
      (for example, by canonicalizing as defined by 
      <a data-cite="bcp47#section-4.5">BCP 47 section 4.5</a>).
      </p>

    <p>A literal is a <dfn id="dfn-dir-lang-string">directional language-tagged string</dfn>
      if both the third element and fourth elements are present.
      The third element, the language tag, is treated identically as in a <a>language-tagged string</a>,
      and the fourth element, <a>base direction</a>, MUST be either `ltr` or `rtl`, which MUST be in lower case.</p>

    <p>The meanings of the <a>base direction</a> values are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>`ltr`: indicates that the initial text direction is set to left-to-right.</li>
      <li>`rtl`: indicates that the initial text direction is set to right-to-left.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please note that concrete syntaxes MAY support
      <dfn data-lt="simple literal" class="export">simple literals</dfn> consisting of only a
      <a>lexical form</a> without any <a>datatype IRI</a>, <a>language tag</a>, or <a>base direction</a>.
      Simple literals are syntactic sugar for abstract syntax
      <a>literals</a>
      with the <a>datatype IRI</a>
      <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string</code>
      (which is commonly abbreviated as <code>xsd:string</code>).
      Similarly, most concrete syntaxes represent
      <a>language-tagged strings</a> and <a>directional language-tagged strings</a> without
      the <a>datatype IRI</a> because it always equals either
      <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString</code> (<code>rdf:langString</code>)
      or <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#dirLangString</code> (<code>rdf:dirLangString</code>), respectively.</p>

    <p>The <dfn>literal value</dfn> associated with a <a>literal</a> is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If the literal is a <a>language-tagged string</a>,
        then the literal value is a pair consisting of its <a>lexical form</a>
        and its <a>language tag</a>, in that order.</li>
      <li>If the literal is a <a>directional language-tagged string</a>, then the literal value is
        a tuple of its <a>lexical form</a>, its <a>language tag</a>, and its <a>base direction</a>,
        likewise in that order.</li>
      <li>If the literal's <a>datatype</a> is handled by an RDF implmentation,

          <li>if the literal's <a>lexical form</a> is in the <a>lexical space</a>
            of the <a>datatype</a>, then the literal value is the result of applying
            the <a>lexical-to-value mapping</a> of the datatype to the
            <a>lexical form</a>.</li>
          <li>otherwise, the literal is <dfn data-lt-no-plural>ill-typed</dfn> and no literal value can be
             associated with the literal. Such a case produces a semantic
             inconsistency but is not <em>syntactically</em> ill-formed.
             Implementations SHOULD accept [=ill-typed=] literals and produce RDF
             graphs from them. Implementations MAY produce warnings when
             encountering [=ill-typed=] literals.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If the literal's <a>datatype IRI</a> is <em>not</em>
        handled by an RDF implementation, then the literal value is
        not defined by this specification. Implementations SHOULD accept
        literals with unknown datatype IRIs and produce RDF graphs from them.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><dfn data-local-lt="term-equal">Literal term equality</dfn>:
      Two literals are term-equal (the same <a>RDF literal</a>)
      if and only if:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the two <a>lexical forms</a> compare equal</li>
      <li>the two <a>datatype IRIs</a> compare equal</li>
      <li>the two <a>language tags</a> (if any) compare equal</li>
      <li>the two <a>base directions</a> (if any) compare equal</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Comparison is performed using

      (see description of string comparison in

      except for language tags, where the comparison is performed using 
      <a data-cite="I18N-GLOSSARY#dfn-case-sensitive">ASCII case-insensitive matching</a>.
      Thus, two literals can have the same value
      without being the same <a>RDF term</a>.

    <h3>Blank Nodes</h3>

    <p><dfn data-lt="blank node">Blank nodes</dfn> are disjoint from

      <p><span id="dfn-blank-node-identifiers"><!-- obsolete term--></span><dfn data-lt="blank node identifier">Blank node identifiers</dfn>
      are local identifiers that are used in some
      <a>concrete RDF syntaxes</a>
      or RDF store implementations.
      They are always locally scoped to the file or RDF store,
      and are <em>not</em> persistent or portable identifiers
      for blank nodes. Blank node identifiers are <em>not</em>
      part of the RDF abstract syntax, but are entirely dependent
      on the concrete syntax or implementation. The syntactic restrictions
      on blank node identifiers, if any, therefore also depend on
      the concrete RDF syntax or implementation.  Implementations that handle blank node
      identifiers in concrete syntaxes need to be careful not to create the
      same blank node from multiple occurrences of the same blank node identifier

    <h3>Triple Terms</h3>

    <p>An [=RDF triple=] used as the [=object=] of another [=triple=] is called a <dfn class=export >triple term</dfn>.
      In a given [=RDF graph=], a [=triple=] can appear as a [=triple term=], an [=asserted triple=], or both.
    </p>

    <p>The set of [=RDF terms=] <dfn class=export data-lt="appear">appearing</dfn> in an [=RDF triple=] |t| is defined inductively as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The [=subject=], [=predicate=] and [=object=] of |t| [=appear=] in |t|.
      <li>If a [=triple term=] |t2| appears in |t|, then any [=RDF term=] [=appearing=] in |t2| also [=appears=] in |t|.
    </ul>

    <p>By extension, an [=RDF term=] is said to [=appear=] in an [=RDF graph=] if it appears in an [=asserted triple=] of that graph. An [=RDF triple=] is said to [=appear=] in an [=RDF graph=] if it is either an [=asserted triple=] of that graph or a [=triple term=] [=appearing=] in that graph.</p>

    <p class="note">Every <a>triple</a> with a <a>triple term</a> as its [=object=] SHOULD
      use <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#reifies</code> (<code>rdf:reifies</code>)
      as its <a>predicate</a>.
      Every <a>triple</a> whose <a>object</a> is not a <a>triple term</a> SHOULD NOT

    <p>The <dfn data-lt="constituent">constituent terms</dfn> (or simply constituents)

      By extension, the [=constituent terms=] of an [=RDF graph=] are all the constituent terms of its triples.

    <h3>Initial Text Direction</h3>

    <p>The <a>base direction</a> of a <a>directional language-tagged string</a>
      provides a means of establishing the initial direction of text,
      including text which is a mixture of right-to-left and left-to-right scripts.
      The [=Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm=] [[?I18N-Glossary]] provides support for automatically rendering
      a sequence of characters in logical order,
      so that they are visually ordered as expected,
      but this is not sufficient to correctly render bidirectional text.</p>

    <p>For example, some text with a language tag "`he`" might be displayed
      in a left-to-right context (such as an English web page) as
      <bdi dir="ltr">פעילות הבינאום, W3C</bdi>, which is incorrect. When provided
      to a user agent including base direction information (such as using
      HTML's `dir` attribute) it can then be correctly presented as:
    </p>
    <div lang="he" dir="rtl">פעילות הבינאום, W3C</div>

    <p>In the absence of an explicit initial text direction,
      the [=Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm=] detects the text direction from the content.
      This depends on the first strongly directional character in the text
      or on the context.
      To avoid [=spillover effects=], users need to employ [=bidi isolation=] 
      whenever text is inserted into a larger document.
      For example,
      &quot;<code>&lt;bdi lang="he"&gt;ספרים בינלאומיים!&lt;/bdi&gt;</code>&quot;
      displays the Hebrew characters in a right-to-left fashion
      — i.e., as &quot;<bdi lang="he">ספרים בינלאומיים!</bdi>&quot;
      — while they would be stored in memory as
      &quot;<bdo dir="ltr" lang="he">ספרים בינלאומיים!</bdo>&quot;</p>

  <section id="section-skolemization">
    <h3>Replacing Blank Nodes with IRIs</h3>

    <p>Blank nodes do not have identifiers in the RDF abstract syntax. The
      <a>blank node identifiers</a> introduced
      by some concrete syntaxes have only
      local scope and are purely an artifact of the serialization.</p>

    <p>In situations where stronger identification is needed, systems MAY
      systematically replace some or all of the blank nodes in an RDF graph
      with <a>IRIs</a>.  Systems wishing to do this SHOULD
      mint a new, globally
      unique IRI (a <dfn class="export">Skolem IRI</dfn>) for each blank node so replaced.</p>

    <p>This transformation does not appreciably change the meaning of an
      RDF graph, provided that the Skolem IRIs do not occur anywhere else.
      It does however permit the possibility of other graphs
      subsequently using the Skolem IRIs, which is not possible
      for blank nodes.</p>

    <p>Systems may wish to mint Skolem IRIs in such a way that they can
      recognize the IRIs as having been introduced solely to replace blank
      nodes. This allows a system to map IRIs back to blank nodes
      if needed.</p>

    <p>Systems that want Skolem IRIs to be recognizable outside of the system
      boundaries SHOULD use a well-known IRI [[RFC8615]] with the registered
      name <code>genid</code>. This is an IRI that uses the HTTP or HTTPS scheme,
      or another scheme that has been specified to use well-known IRIs; and whose
      path component starts with <code>/.well-known/genid/</code>.

    <p>For example, the authority responsible for the domain
      <code>example.com</code> could mint the following recognizable Skolem IRI:</p>

    <pre>http://example.com/.well-known/genid/d26a2d0e98334696f4ad70a677abc1f6</pre>

    <p class="note">RFC 8615 [[RFC8615]] only specifies well-known URIs,
      not IRIs. For the purpose of this document, a well-known IRI is any
      IRI that results in a well-known <a>URI</a> after IRI-to-URI mapping [[!RFC3987]].</p>

<section id="section-Datatypes">
  <h2>Datatypes</h2>

  <p>Datatypes are used with RDF <a>literals</a>
    to represent values such as strings, numbers and dates.
    The datatype abstraction used in RDF is compatible with XML Schema
    [[!XMLSCHEMA11-2]]. Any datatype definition that conforms
    to this abstraction MAY be used in RDF, even if not defined
    in terms of XML Schema. RDF re-uses many of the XML Schema
    built-in datatypes, and defines three additional datatypes,
    <code><a>rdf:JSON</a></code>, <code><a>rdf:HTML</a></code>, and <code><a>rdf:XMLLiteral</a></code>.
  </p>

  <p>A <dfn>datatype</dfn> consists of a <a>lexical space</a>,
    a <a>value space</a> and a <a>lexical-to-value mapping</a>, and
    is identified by one or more <a>IRIs</a>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>lexical space</dfn> of a datatype is a set of <a>strings</a>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>lexical-to-value mapping</dfn> of a datatype is a set of
    pairs whose first element belongs to the <a>lexical space</a>,
    and the second element belongs to the <dfn>value space</dfn>
    of the datatype. Each member of the lexical space is paired with exactly
    one value, and is a <em>lexical representation</em>
    of that value. The mapping can be seen as a function
    from the lexical space to the value space.</p>

  <p class="note" id="note-lang-strings"><a>Language-tagged strings</a> have the <a>datatype IRI</a>
    <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString</code>
    (commonly abbreviated as <code>rdf:langString</code>).
    No datatype is formally defined for this IRI because the definition
    of <a>datatypes</a> does not accommodate
    <a>language tags</a> in the <a>lexical space</a>.
    The <a>value space</a> associated with this datatype IRI is the set
    of all pairs that consist of a string and a language tag.
    Similarly, <a>directional language-tagged strings</a>
    <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#dirLangString</code>
    (commonly abbreviated as <code>rdf:dirLangString</code>)
    also have a <a>base direction</a> in the value space.
    The <a>value space</a> associated with this datatype IRI is the set
    of all 3-tuples of a string, a language tag and a base direction.
  </p>

  <p>For example, the XML Schema datatype <code>xsd:boolean</code>,
    where each member of the <a>value space</a> has two lexical
    representations, is defined as follows:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Lexical space:</dt>
    <dd>{“<code>true</code>”, “<code>false</code>”, “<code>1</code>”, “<code>0</code>”}</dd>
    <dt>Value space:</dt>
    <dd>{<em><strong>true</strong></em>, <em><strong>false</strong></em>}</dd>
    <dt>Lexical-to-value mapping</dt>
    <dd>{
        &lt;“<code>true</code>”, <em><strong>true</strong></em>&gt;,
        &lt;“<code>false</code>”, <em><strong>false</strong></em>&gt;,
        &lt;“<code>1</code>”, <em><strong>true</strong></em>&gt;,
        &lt;“<code>0</code>”, <em><strong>false</strong></em>&gt;,
        }</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <a>literals</a> that can be defined using this
    datatype are:</p>

  <table id="tab-boolean-literals" class="simple">
    <caption>This table lists the literals of type xsd:boolean.</caption>

    <h3>Datatype IRIs</h3>

    <p>Datatypes are identified by <a>IRIs</a>.</p>
    <p>
      If any IRI of the form
      <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#xxx</code> is handled by an RDF implementation, it
      MUST refer to the RDF-compatible XSD type named <code>xsd:xxx</code> for
      every XSD type listed in <a href="#xsd-datatypes">section 5.1</a>.</p>

    <p>The datatypes identified by the three IRIs below are defined in
    Appendix&nbsp;<a href="#section-additional-datatypes" class="sectionRef"></a>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The IRI <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral</code>
        refers to the datatype <code><a>rdf:XMLLiteral</a></code>.</li>
      <li>The IRI <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML</code>
        refers to the datatype <code><a>rdf:HTML</a></code>.</li>
      <li>The IRI <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#JSON</code>
        refers to the datatype <code><a>rdf:JSON</a></code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>RDF implementations are not required to handle all datatypes.
      Any literal typed with a datatype not handled by an RDF implementation
      is treated just like an unknown IRI, i.e., as referring to an unknown thing.
      Applications MAY give a warning message if they are unable to determine the
      referent of an IRI used in a typed literal. RDF implementations SHOULD NOT
      reject a literal with an unknown datatype as either a syntactic or
      semantic error.<p>

    <p>Other specifications MAY impose additional constraints on
      <a>datatype IRIs</a>, for example, require support
      for certain datatypes.</p>

    <p class="note">Semantic extensions of RDF might choose to
      recognize other datatype IRIs
      and require each of them to refer to a fixed datatype.
      See [[[RDF12-SEMANTICS]]] [[RDF12-SEMANTICS]] for more information on
      semantic extensions.</p>

    <p class="note" id="note-custom-datatypes">The Web Ontology Language
      [[OWL2-OVERVIEW]] offers facilities for formally defining

  <h2>Fragment Identifiers</h2>

  <p>RDF uses <a>IRIs</a>, which may include
    <span id="dfn-fragment-identifiers"><!-- obsolete term--></span>
    <dfn data-lt="fragment identifier" class="no-export">fragment identifiers</dfn>,
    as resource identifiers.
    The semantics of fragment identifiers is
    <a data-cite="rfc3986#section-3.5">defined in
    RFC 3986</a> [[RFC3986]]: They identify a secondary resource
    that is usually a part of, a view of, defined in, or described in
    the primary resource, and the precise semantics depend on the set
    of representations that might result from a retrieval action
    on the primary resource.</p>

  <p>This section discusses the handling of fragment identifiers
    in representations that encode <a>RDF graphs</a>.</p>

  <p>In RDF-bearing representations of a primary resource, e.g.,
    <code>&lt;https://example.com/foo&gt;</code>,
    the secondary resource identified by a fragment identifier, e.g., <code>bar</code>,
    is the <a>resource</a> <a>denoted</a> by the
    full <a>IRI</a> in the <a>RDF graph</a>, which would be <code>&lt;https://example.com/foo#bar&gt;</code> in this case.
    Since IRIs in RDF graphs can denote anything, this can be
    something external to the representation, or even external
    to the web.</p>

  <p>In this way, the RDF-bearing representation acts as an intermediary
    between the web-accessible primary resource, and some set of possibly
    non-web or abstract entities that the <a>RDF graph</a> may describe.</p>

  <p>In cases where other specifications constrain the semantics of
    <a>fragment identifiers</a> in RDF-bearing representations, the encoded
    <a>RDF graph</a> should use fragment identifiers in a way that is consistent
    with these constraints. For example, in an HTML+RDFa document [[HTML-RDFA]],
    a fragment identifier such as <code>chapter1</code> may identify a document section
    via the semantics of HTML's <code>@name</code> or <code>@id</code>
    attributes. Such an <a>IRI</a>, e.g., <code>&lt;#chapter1&gt;</code>, should
    then be taken to <a>denote</a> that same section in any RDFa-encoded
    <a>triples</a> within the same document.
    Similarly, fragment identifiers should be used consistently in resources
    with multiple representations that are made available via
    <a data-cite="webarch/#frag-coneg">content negotiation</a>
    [[WEBARCH]]. For example, if the fragment identifier <code>chapter1</code> identifies a
    document section in an HTML representation of the primary resource, then the
    <a>IRI</a> <code>&lt;#chapter1&gt;</code> should be taken to
    <a>denote</a> that same section in all RDF-bearing representations of the
    same primary resource.</p>

  <h2>Generalizations of RDF Triples, Graphs, and Datasets</h2>

  <p>It is sometimes convenient to loosen the requirements

    a notion of symmetric RDF triples.</p>

  <p>
    A <dfn class="export">symmetric RDF triple</dfn> allows the subject to be

  <p class=issue>Should we make this section normative?</p>

  <p>This section provides transformations between [=Full=] [=RDF graphs=] (resp. [=RDF datasets=]) and [=Classic=] [=RDF graphs=] (resp. [=RDF datasets=]),
  to provide some level of interoperability between the different classes of <a href="#conformance">Conformance</a>.

  <p class=issue>Should we go even further and aim to provide interoperability between <em>RDF 1.1</em> and RDF 1.2 [=Full=]?</p>

  <p class=issue>AT RISK: The Working Group may decide to replace the terms `rdf:TripleTerm`, `rdf:ttSubject`, `rdf:ttPredicate`, and `rdf:ttObject` used in this section with other terms, possibly in a different namespace.</p>

  <p>These transformation are designed to be:</p>

  <dl>

    <dd>It must be possible to reconstruct the input graph (resp. dataset) from the output graph (resp. dataset).

    <h2>From [=Full=] to [=Classic=]</h2>

    <p>
      Encoding an [=RDF graph=] to ensure that it is consumable by an RDF [=Classic=] implementation is called <dfn data-lt="classicize|classicized">classicizing</dfn> it.
      [=Classicizing=] consists of repeating the following steps until no [=constituent=] of the graph is a [=triple term=], and the graph is therefore compliant with RDF [=Classic=]: while the graph has a [=triple term=] <var>tt</var> in its [=constituent terms=], of minting a fresh [=blank node=] <var>b</var>
      (i.e., a blank node not yet in use in the graph); replacing each <var>tt</var> with <var>b</var> in all the triples of the graph having <var>tt</var> in their [=constituents=];
      and then adding the following triples to the graph (where <var>s</var>, <var>p</var>, and <var>o</var> are respectively the [=subject=], [=predicate=] and [=object=] of <var>tt</var>):
    </p>
    <ul>

      <li>(<var>b</var>, `rdf:ttObject`, <var>o</var>)
    </ul>

    <p>Note that this transformation is <em>information preserving</em> only when the input graph does not contain at the same time a [=triple term=]
      and an [=asserted=] triple (<var>b</var>, `rdf:type`, `rdf:TripleTerm`) where <var>b</var> is a [=blank node=].
      Implementations encountering this situation MUST report an error.
      This limitation is discussed in Section <a href="#section-classicize-caveat"></a>.

    <h2>From [=Classic=] to [=Full=]</h2>

    <p>Reverting a [=classicized=] graph to its original form consists of locating
      each [=asserted=] triple (<var>b</var>, `rdf:type`, `rdf:TripleTerm`)
      that has a [=blank node=] <var>b</var> as its subject, 
      along with the three associated [=asserted=] triples 
      that have the same [=blank node=] <var>b</var> as their subjects, i.e.,
      (<var>b</var>, `rdf:ttSubject`, <var>s</var>),
      (<var>b</var>, `rdf:ttPredicate`, <var>p</var>),
      and (<var>b</var>, `rdf:ttObject`, <var>o</var>);
      removing these four triples from the graph;
      and replacing all remaining occurrences of <var>b</var> 
      as a [=constituent term=] of the graph 
      with the triple term (<var>s</var>, <var>p</var>, <var>o</var>).
    </p>

    <p>An implementation MUST report an error if, for a given <var>b</var>,
      it can not unambiguously determine <var>s</var>, <var>p</var>, or <var>o</var>
      (i.e., if one of the `classicize:` properties
      — `rdf:ttSubject`, `rdf:ttPredicate`, or `rdf:ttObject` —
      of <var>b</var> is missing or duplicated).
      An implementation MUST also report an error if the input graph contains
      at the same time a [=triple term=] and an [=asserted triple=]
      (<var>b</var>, `rdf:type`, `rdf:TripleTerm`) 
      where <var>b</var> is the same [=blank node=].
      Note that none of these situations can occur if the input graph was produced by the [=classicize=] transformation.
    </p>

    <p>To revert a [=classicized=] [=RDF dataset=] to its original form, the transformation above is applied to its [=default graph=] and to each of its [=named graphs=].
    </p>

    <p>Note that this transformation has no effect on any [=RDF graph=] or [=RDF dataset=] that does not use the `rdf:TripleTerm` type,
      including [=Full=] graphs or datasets containing [=triple terms=].
      This makes this transformation <em>idempotent</em> as intended.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="section-classicize-caveat">
    <h2>Limitations</h2>

    <p>The two transformations above explicitly do not support graphs or datasets containing at the same time a [=triple term=] and an [=asserted triple=]
      (<var>b</var>, `rdf:type`, `rdf:TripleTerm`) 
      where <var>b</var> is the same [=blank node=].
      This means that the [=classicize=] transformation is not <em>strictly</em> universal.
    </p>

    <p>This limitation should not be an issue in practice.
      The `rdf:TripleTerm` type is unlikely to be in used in any published graph or dataset,
      as it was not defined prior to this specification.
      For this reason, using it would actually have been bad practice.
      For future graphs and datasets, this type should be considered to be reserved for use within the [=classicize=] transformation, and not used otherwise.
    </p>

    <p class=note>
      This is one reason why this transformation introduces new vocabulary terms
      (`rdf:TripleTerm`, `rdf:ttSubject`, `rdf:ttPredicate`, `rdf::ttObject`),
      rather than repurposing the existing <a data-cite="RDF12-SCHEMA#ch_reificationvocab">reification vocabulary</a>
      (`rdf:Statement`, `rdf:subject`, `rdf:predicate`, `rdf:object`).
      Unlike `rdf:TripleTerm`, `rdf:Statement` is known to be found in
      widely used datasets (e.g., <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/">Uniprot</a>),
      so reserving its use for the [=classicize=] transformation was not an option.
    </p>

    <p>Another consequence of this restriction is that users will need to be aware and careful when merging graphs in an application that [=classicizes=] graphs or datasets.
      The concern is that merging a [=Full=] [=RDF graph=] containing at least one [=triple term=]
      with a [=classicized=] [=RDF graph=] (which might contain [=blank node=] instances of `rdf:TripleTerm`)
      could result in a "hybrid" graph that cannot be transformed to a consistent [=Full=] nor [=Classic=] [=RDF graph=].
      Therefor, such applications should [=classicize=] every graph prior to merging them.
      Conversely, applications supporting RDF [=Full=] should make sure to apply the reverse transformation
      to any graph that is known or likely to have been [=classicized=],
      to avoid creating such "hybrid" graphs.
      Since these transformations are designed to be <em>idempotent</em>, there is no harm in applying them more than necessary.

  <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>
  <p>RDF is used to express arbitrary application data,
    which may include the expression of personally identifiable information (PII)
    or other information which could be considered sensitive.
    Authors publishing such information are advised to carefully
    consider the needs and use of publishing such information,
    as well as the applicable regulations for the regions where the data is
    expected to be consumed and potentially revealed (e.g., 
    <a href="https://gdpr.eu/">GDPR</a>, 
    <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a>,
    <a href="https://termly.io/resources/infographics/privacy-laws-around-the-world/">others</a>),
    particularly whether authorization measures are needed for access to the data.</p>
</section>

<section id="security" class="appendix informative">
  <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

  <p>The RDF Abstract Syntax is not used directly for conveying information,
    although concrete serialization forms are specifically intended to do so.</p>

  <p>Applications MAY evaluate given data to infer more assertions or to dereference <a>IRIs</a>,
    invoking the security considerations of the scheme for that IRI.
    Note in particular, the privacy issues in [[RFC3023]] section 10 for HTTP IRIs.
    Data obtained from an inaccurate or malicious data source may lead to inaccurate or misleading conclusions,
    as well as the dereferencing of unintended IRIs.
    Care must be taken to align the trust in consulted resources with the sensitivity of
    the intended use of the data;
    inferences of potential medical treatments would likely require different trust than inferences
    for trip planning.</p>

  <p>RDF is used to express arbitrary application data;
    security considerations will vary by domain of use.
    Security tools and protocols applicable to text
    (for example, PGP encryption, checksum validation, password-protected compression)
    may also be used on RDF documents.
    Security/privacy protocols must be imposed which reflect the sensitivity of the embedded information.</p>

  <p>RDF can express data which is presented to the user, such as RDF Schema labels.
    Applications rendering <a>strings</a> retrieved from untrusted RDF documents,
    or using unescaped characters,
    SHOULD use warnings and other appropriate means to limit the possibility
    that malignant strings might be used to mislead the reader.
    The security considerations in the media type registration for XML ([[RFC3023]] section 10)
    provide additional guidance around the expression of arbitrary data and markup.</p>

  <p>RDF uses <a>IRIs</a> as term identifiers.
    Applications interpreting data expressed in RDF SHOULD address the security issues of
    [[[RFC3987]]] [[RFC3987]] Section 8, as well as
    [[[RFC3986]]] [[RFC3986]] Section 7.</p>

  <p>Multiple <a>IRIs</a> may have the same appearance.
     Characters in different scripts may look similar (for instance,
     a Cyrillic &quot;&#1086;&quot; may appear similar to a Latin &quot;o&quot;).
     A character followed by combining characters may have the same visual representation
     as another character (for example, LATIN SMALL LETTER "E" followed by COMBINING ACUTE
     ACCENT has the same visual representation as LATIN SMALL LETTER "E" WITH ACUTE).
     Any person or application that is writing or interpreting data in RDF
     must take care to use the IRI that matches the intended semantics,
     and avoid IRIs that may look similar.

  <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>
  <p>Unicode [[UNICODE]] provides a mechanism for signaling direction within a string
    (see [=Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm=] [[I18N-Glossary]]).
    RDF provides a mechanism for specifying the <a>base direction</a>
    of a <a>directional language-tagged string</a>
    to signal the initial text direction of a string.
    For most human language strings, but particularly for those
    whose base direction cannot be accurately determined from the 
    string content, is it valuable to have an external indicator in order
    to get the proper display and isolation of the value.
    One example of such an indicator is
    the [[HTML]] <a data-cite="HTML/dom.html#the-dir-attribute">dir attribute</a>;
    see [[STRING-META]].</p>

  <p>[[[JSON-LD11]]] [[JSON-LD11]] introduced the
    <a data-cite="JSON-LD11#the-i18n-namespace">i18n namespace</a> to use
    a datatype to specify both the base direction an <a>language tag</a>
    of an <a>RDF literal</a>.</p>

  <h2>Changes between RDF 1.1 and RDF 1.2</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Added <a href="#section-dataset-quad" class="sectionRef"></a>
      for informative definition of a <a>quad</a>.</li>
   <li>Added <a href="#section-triple-terms-reification" class="sectionRef"></a>
      and definitions for <a>triple term</a> and <a>asserted triple</a>
      and extended the definition of
      <a>RDF triple</a> to permit triple terms as objects.
      Also defines <a>reifier</a> and <a>reifying triple</a>.</li>
    <li>Added the <a>base direction</a> element as part of 
      a <a>literal</a>,
      and a description of its use in <a href="#section-text-direction" class="sectionRef"></a>.</li>
    <li>Improved the use of IRI terminology,
      and added <a href="#iri-abnf" class="sectionRef"></a>.
      This improves the language using <a>relative IRI references</a>
      and clarifies that, in the abstract syntax, IRIs are resolved,
      avoiding the incorrect use of "absolute IRI".</li>
    <li>Changed reference from DOM4, which was not a recommendation at the time, to [[DOM]],
      making the definitions of <a>rdf:HTML</a> and <a>rdf:XMLLiteral</a> datatypes normative.</li>
    <li>Added <a href="#section-additional-datatypes" class="sectionRef"></a>
      and moved the sections about the <a>rdf:HTML</a> and <a>rdf:XMLLiteral</a>
      datatypes to this appendix.</li>
    <li>Added the <a>rdf:JSON</a> datatype, the definition of which is adopted
      from <a data-cite="?JSON-LD11#the-rdf-json-datatype">Section&nbsp;10.2 The `rdf:JSON` Datatype</a>
      in [[?JSON-LD11]].
      Note that the <a href="#JSON-value-space">value space</a> defined here
      updates the <a>value space</a> of the
      <a data-cite="JSON-LD11#the-rdf-json-datatype">`rdf:JSON`</a> datatype defined in [[[JSON-LD11]]] [[JSON-LD11]]</li>
    <li>Clarify Unicode terminology,
      using <a data-cite="I18N-GLOSSARY#dfn-code-point" class="lint-ignore">Unicode code points</a>,
      and restriction to the XML <a data-cite="XML11#charsets">Char</a> production.
      Also removes obsolete recommendations for the use of Normalization Form C in literals.
      Adds a definition of <a>string</a> that can be used in other RDF documents.</li>
    <li>Minor edit
      to improve the example about distinguishing literals, IRIs, and blank nodes
      in <a href="#section-triples" class="sectionRef"></a>.</li>
    <li>Implementations were previously allowed to normalize language tags to lower case,
      which made it ambiguous whether two literals with language tags
      that differed only by case represented the same literal,
      or distinct literals.
      RDF 1.2 requires that language tags be case-insensitively unique 
      but does not specify the common formatting to be used.
      Two literals with the same lexical form and language tags that differ only by case
      are the same literal.
      Implementations can either follow the advice to normalize to lower case,
      use the recommended BCP47 format,
      or do something else, as long it is performed consistently.</li>
    <li>Removed the section on the canonical mapping for the <a>rdf:XMLLiteral</a> datatype.</li>
    <li>Refer to the definition and discussion of 
      <a data-cite="RDF12-SEMANTICS#dfn-recognize">RDF Semantics, "recognizing"</a>
      datatype IRIs, instead of <em>Recognized datatype IRIs</em>.</li>
    <li>The informal terminolgy "RDF processor" has been removed.</li>
  </ul>
